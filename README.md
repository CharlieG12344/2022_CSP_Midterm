## Directions:
Within this repository your will find two python files.  For each of them, read the directions *(written in the comments)* and design the program.

For each make sure you include the following
* Program should compile and run
* All variables and function names should use self-commenting identifiers
* Place comments in your code where appropriate to make it easier to read

If you have any questions feel free to ask.  I won't help you write the code, but I will help you understand the challenges.
